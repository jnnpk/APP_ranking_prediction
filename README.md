This aims to investigate the key determinant factors of the success of mobile apps. 
Specifically, our research question is whether the amount of superficial visual information provided by the platform affects the sales of the application. 
We focus on how information about the app, which is accessible on the app’s download page, significantly influences the application’s success based on top rankings.
App developers are one of the primary target audiences of the current study. We believe that our findings will be particularly beneficial for app developers as they are the ones who make the mobile app information such as updated versions, app size, or developer information. 
Our study will help app developers to determine which factors to focus on or prioritize to encourage customers to purchase the apps (and therefore, reach higher sales).

Our data was collected from the U.S Apple App Store. Even with less than 15 percent market share, Apple App Store has led the way in revenue generation for app developers. Moreover, iPhone is becoming increasingly popular in regions with high income, especially in the United States, which also tend to spend more on purchasing apps. As a result, App revenue on Apple Store increased by 32.7% in 2021 to $32.8 billion which is far higher than that of Google Play ($10.6 billion; Business of Apps, 2022).
We have collected the list of applications ranging from top 1 to 299 in sales from different categories (Books, Business, Education, Finance, Games, Health, Lifestyle, Medical, Music, and Productivity) on 1st January, 2013. We collected a total of 2,990 application samples and the detailed data for each sample was additionally collected from the downland and information page on the platform.
